# Hi DevOps;

This is a simple Day Care Management System I built using JavaScript PHP and MySQL.
I hope my code can be a foundation for a better project.

# How It Works

The program currently has 3 users :
1. Accountant
2. Administrator
3. HR

There is a "new_user_files_here" folder that you can use to add an extra user logic.

Each User has specific Functions;

1. Accountant -  Incharge of the Finance Module.
2. Administrator - Incharge of the Day Care Administrative Module.
3. HR - Incharge of the Employee Management Module


NB: I have included all the necessary files required.

Happy Coding !!!
